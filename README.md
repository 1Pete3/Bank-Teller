# Bank Teller
## Overview
This program was created to represent the transaction that a bank teller may encounter. This program has only been tested in the google cloud shell editor so please use that. The user is required to login to the program first with a password before anything can be done. Default password is password.

 The user uses a menu (see image below) to do certain transactions or by using command-line arguments. Available command-line arguments include: 
*  **./a.out create** - to create a new bank account
* 	**./a.out show** - to show all the bank accounts
* 	**./a.out deposit** - for a deposit
* 	**./a.out withdraw** - for a withdraw
* 	**./a.out fee** - to apply a fee
* 	**./a.out balance** - for a balance inquiry
* 	**./a.out menu** - to access the menu
* 	**./a.out** â€“ to see all available command-line arguments

When using the menu, the program will prompt the user to enter a number 1 -7 to access the contents of the menu. For the deposit, withdraw, apply fee and check balance functions, the user is required to enter a valid bank account number else they will be returned to the main menu. To view an account the user can enter 2 to show all the accounts and right-click and copy/paste to make it easier.
